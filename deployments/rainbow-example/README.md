# Rainbow Example

This deployment contains a description and Docker container build file for a simple example of Rainbow built on top of the SWIM simulator 
[link](https://github.com/cp2-sei/swim). This example is intended as a simple demonstration of how Rainbow can be used to adapt a system. 
It differs from a *real* deployment in two important ways:

1. The system being adapted is a simulation rather than a real system
2. All of the Rainbow system elements (gauges, models, effectors, probe) run in one process, rather than being distributed over multiple 
machines which is more likely in a real, distributed system.

## Building and running the example
Instructions for building and running the example can be found [here](docker/INSTRUCTIONS.md).
